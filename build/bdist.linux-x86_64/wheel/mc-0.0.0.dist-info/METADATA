Summary: These are all scripts to run the multiple clocks project.

In particular, there are several sub-modules that do different things. 
    Firstly, the simulation sub-module allows to create a 3x3 grid with 4 rewards on it, and 
    codes predictions of neural firing pattern for space and multiple phase clocks.
