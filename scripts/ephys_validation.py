This script validates my models with Mohamadys ephys data, making use of an RSA.
This is the plan:
 1.  Based on a location file (do you have something like that?),  model how the mouse was running: where was it for how long
 2.  Create a model RDM (time x time) based on my model using the coordinates from step (1)
 3.  Run an RSA where I compute data a RDM from all of your neuron time-series (all neurons across time, then correlate the time x time axes for the RDM)
 4.  Run a regression between my model RDM and your data RDM
 
 
 'Data is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vJw8AVZmHQrUnvqkASUwAd4t549uKN6b'
 
 There are several neurons that have been recorded per task configuration. 
 
 For every recording, I have a task_configuration file.
 e.g. for the first day, the mice did 9 different tasks. 
 Therefore, I have 9 different files for neurons + locations for that day.
 Within the loc files, there are multiple runs of this same task configuration.
 Within the neuron files, there are multiple neurons and runs of this same task configuration.

##Neuron npy files:
These contain the normalized firing rates of each neuron - spikes per frame (frame rate is 60 Hz)

npy files for each session
matrix with dimensions [neuron,trial,bin]

360 bins per trial, every state is 90 bins

##Location npy files:
These contain the location of the animal in each bin (should correspond exactly to the neuron bins)
locations1-9 are the 9 nodes

Then the remaining locations 10-21 are the bridges, coded in the "Edge_grid" array. just subtract 10 and that
gives you the index of the Edge_grid array which tells you which bridges are being referenced
e.g. an entry of 10 means index 0 which is array([1, 2]) (i.e. animal is at the the bridge between nodes 1 and 2)

##task_data
this is the task sequence used for that day (which nodes are rewarded in what order)
