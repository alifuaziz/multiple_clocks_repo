This script validates my models with Mohamadys ephys data, making use of an RSA.
This is the plan:
 1.  Based on a location file (do you have something like that?),  model how the mouse was running: where was it for how long
 2.  Create a model RDM (time x time) based on my model using the coordinates from step (1)
 3.  Run an RSA where I compute data a RDM from all of your neuron time-series (all neurons across time, then correlate the time x time axes for the RDM)
 4.  Run a regression between my model RDM and your data RDM

###Data structure###
####################


##Neuron npy files:
These contain the normalized firing rates of each neuron - spikes per frame (frame rate is 60 Hz)

npy files for each session
matrix with dimensions [neuron,trial,bin]

360 bins per trial, every state is 90 bins

##Location npy files:
These contain the location of the animal in each bin (should correspond exactly to the neuron bins)
locations1-9 are the 9 nodes

Then the remaining locations 10-21 are the bridges, coded in the "Edge_grid" array. just subtract 10 and that
gives you the index of the Edge_grid array which tells you which bridges are being referenced
e.g. an entry of 10 means index 0 which is array([1, 2]) (i.e. animal is at the the bridge between nodes 1 and 2)

##task_data
this is the task sequence used for that day (which nodes are rewarded in what order)
