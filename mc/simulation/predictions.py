This module generates hypothesis matrices of neural activity based on 
predictions for location and phase-clock neurons.
It also includes functions to plot those.

# If you successfully ran mc.simulation.grid.create_grid() and mc.simulation.grid.walk_paths(reward_coords),
# you now have 4 locations, 4 states, and paths between the locations/states,
# including going back to A after D.
# 4 locations: coordinates in points[0:4]
# 4 states: points[0:4]
# 4 paths between locations/states: all_paths[0:4]
# A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A
# (number of steps for each path: all_stepnums)

# the next step is thus to now create a prediction for neural firing of location neurons,
# and the same thing for phase neurons based on the multiple clock model.

# there will be a matrix of 9*3*12 (field-anchors * phases * neurons) x 12 (3phase*4rewards)
# activate: phase1-field-clock for an early field
# activate: phase2-field-clock for a -1reward field (just before).
# activate: phase3-field-clock for a reward-field.
# advance every activated clock for progressing 'one phase'

# input is: reshaped_visited_fields and all_stepnums from mc.simulation.grid.walk_paths(reward_coords)
